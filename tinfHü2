TINF ASSIGNMENT 02 


-> fork :  fork()  creates  a new process by duplicating the calling process.
                    It has the same data as the Parents process. You use it for other Code paths

->stat:             These funktion returns informations about a file. You dont need permissions.
                    The stats are pointed in a a buffer.

-> kill:            kill command to terminates stalled or unwanted processes without having to log out or restart the server.

-> mmap:            creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the
                    calling process.  The starting address for the new mapping is
                    specified in addr.  The length argument specifies the length of the
                    mapping

-> chmod:           This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod. chmod changes the file mode bits
                    of each given file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes
                    to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

-> waitpid:         All of these system calls are used to wait for state changes in a child of the calling process,
                    and obtain information about the child whose state has changed. A state change is considered to be:
                    the child terminated; the child was stopped by a signal; or the child was resumed by a signal.

Fail Conditions

-> fork:            fails if maximum processes are reached or memory is full

-> exec:            fails if the process image is invalid or false filename

-> unlink:          fails if the file is already unlinked/not found or the file is used by another process or not allowed to delete because of its security.

-> read:            fails if the file doesn't exist, or because of no  premissions. or a DIR or simly an I/O error not caused by the system call
                    itself.

-> mount:           fails if read only DIR, corrupt files, wrong path or source already mounted.

->chmod:            fails if used false filepath

-> kill:              fails if invalid PPID is used

TRAPS:

A trap is used to enter kernel mode. The system ( kernel ) instruction is loaded and the trap is called and those loaded instructions will be done.
